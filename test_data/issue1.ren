// TODO: Make this work. This variable is being compared to the `test_struct_i8.inner` at
//       line 40, so the inner should be infereed to being i8. This isn't the case currently,
//       it is infered to being a unknown int and becomes i32 because the type of the `i4`
//       is prefereed, and the assert with the i8 is solved "to late".
